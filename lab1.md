![Image](cd.png)

When running the 'cd' command with no arguments, it changes the working directory to the home directory because no other is inputted; this can be used to reset the working directory. When running 'cd' with a path to a directory, the working directory is set to the input directory. When running 'cd' with a path to a file, the error "not a directory" is printed because a file is not a directory and therefore cannot become the working directory. 

![Image](ls.png)
When running the 'ls' command with no arguments, the root folders in the home directory are printed because there is no path to a specifc directory. When running 'ls' with a path to a directory, the contents of that directory are printed. When running 'ls' with a path to a file, the path is printed because there are no folders or files inside a file. 

![Image](cat.png)
When running the 'cat' command with no arguments, the terminal repeats whatever is next inputted. When running 'cat' with a path to a directory, the terminal prints "Is a directory" because cat can only read contents of files. When running 'cat' with a path to a file, the text within the file is printed out.
